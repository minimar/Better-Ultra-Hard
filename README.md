# Better-Ultra-Hard
Ultra Hard sucks. This mod doesn't make the challenge *good*, but it removes one of it's most annoying and pointless aspects: Curse of The Lost.

With this mod, this curse will simply no longer be applied by this challenge. It will not effect normal runs, nor any other challenge runs.

linedime#7655 on the Modding Of Isaac discord basically wrote this for me, give credit to them. You're free to mirror this to Steam Workshop, Modding Of Isaac, or wherever else, but credit and linking back to this repo would be appreciated.
